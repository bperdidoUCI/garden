### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bperdidoUCI/seedsmart
cd seedsmart
```

2. **Configure the .env file**:
Create a .env file in the root directory of both environments (frontend and backend) and add your environment variables. An example configuration can be found in the .env.example files of both directories.

3. **Frontend**:
API_KEY: Your Trefle API key (obtained from trefle.io)
